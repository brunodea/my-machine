# My Machine Project

This project aims to automatically create a box with the ideal initial setup for my needs.
In order to achieve that I intend to use Virtual Box command line tools and Docker.

I am not sure if this is actually possible to create such a thing with all the setup I would like to have, that is, including a Desktop Environment and everything else.


I still don't know how this project will be structured, but some ideas:
* Docker container is the entire machine that would be used;
* Docker container used for running everything except the Desktop Environment;
* No docker container at all.

We shall see who will win this. Hopefully some new and better ideas will come with time.
